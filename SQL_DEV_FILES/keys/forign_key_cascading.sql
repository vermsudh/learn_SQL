use college;

create table teacher(
	id int primary key,
    name varchar(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES dept(id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE 
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);


-- For example: 

INSERT INTO dept
VALUES
(101, "english"),
(102, "IT");

SELECT * from dept;

INSERT INTO teacher
VALUES
(101, "Suranjali", 101),
(102, "Adam", 102);

SELECT * from teacher;

DROP table teacher;

-- Now we will change the deptid of dept table

UPDATE dept
SET id = 103
WHERE id = 102;

SELECT * from dept;
SELECT * from teacher;

-- Now if you see when we changes the value of the primary key in the dept table, then automatically the dept id got changed in the teacher table
-- This was all possible becasue of cascading the forign key.

-- If we would like to change the data of the forign tbale when the parent table, we will have to use cascading foreign key.
